# Deep XGBoost Image Classifier

For this project I develop a CNN-XGBoost model for image classification. The idea is to leverage CNN's feature extraction capabilities and XGBoost's accuracy when it comes to classification. I will be working with the CIFAR-10 data set and I will be testing the hybrid model on three different CNN architectures. A baseline CNN architecture, the VGG16 architecture, and the ResNet architecture.
